    <p class="p">Eric (often referred to by just his surname Cartman) is the short-tempered,<br> self-centered, manipulative child who is spoiled at home.<br> He is evil, deceitful, scheming, impatient, and intolerant of most races and groups of people he doesn't belong to (Good examples would be Jewish people and hippies).<br> He insults almost everybody in one way or another and,<br> most of the time, lacks any sort of decency and emotion. Even though he hates Kyle,<br> he always interacts with him and constantly talks to or thinks about him. He always calls others "assholes" and tells them to "suck his balls" more than anybody in South Park.<br> For some reason, no matter how many times the others say that they hate him or that he is not their friend,<br> nothing ever gets through his thick skull,<br> nor is he kicked out of the four friends' circle for long.<br> He's considered as the most revolved character on television. Trey Parker and Matt Stone stated (at Comic-Con in 2013) that they would never go out of inspiration for Cartman ("We have to make ourselves find stories that evolve around other characters.")</p> <br>
