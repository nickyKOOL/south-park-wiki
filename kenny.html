    <p class="p">Kenny is the mainly silent character from the series, most recently because he always wears an orange parka that covers his mouth,<br> which makes his speech muffled and difficult to understand.<br> Kenny is most famous for the fact that he dies in almost every episode in the first five seasons and for some reason always comes back for the next episode like nothing ever happened.<br> In Season Fourteen's Coon Trilogy, it is explained that Kenny is immortal and when he appears to die,<br> he always wakes up in his bed and no one else seems to know that he died the day before.<br> Kenny is the most knowledgeable of the four boys when it comes to sexuality and sex.<br> He enjoys pornography, girls, and toilet humor. When he died in the episode "Kenny Dies", he was absent from 'South Park' (physically) for the next season,<br> but returns in the final episode of Season Six,<br> explaining that he was 'just over there'.</p> <br>
